    <div class="description">
        <p id="p1">Dalaguete, officially the Municipality of Dalaguete (Cebuano: Lungsod sa Dalaguete; Tagalog: Bayan ng Dalaguete), is a 1st class municipality in the province of Cebu, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 74,596 people. [3]

            Located 84 kilometres (52 mi) south of Cebu City, Dalaguete is bordered to the north by the town of Argao, to the west are the towns of Badian and Alegria, to the east is the Cebu Strait, and to the south is the town of Alcoy.

        <p style="font-size: 5mm;">In ancient times, before the coming of the Spaniards, these trees had been used by people as major landmarks. People gathered under the encompassing shades and conduct social and economic activities such us festivities, contest, trading meetings, and other community gatherings. 
            They establish market places under the shades of the dalaket where they sell their products and conduct trade with local roving traders bringing in Chinese and Asiatic goods from the port of Cebu.[5]

            The place where the church or the poblacion were laid would have been the site of a communal gathering area for the natives. It was also the abode of a huge dalakit tree which provide shade and shelter while people conduct their activities. 
            "Adto ta mag-abot sa dalakit". "Adto ta magtigom-tigom sa dalakit" [Let us meet at the dalakit]. These and other phrases were common among locals of centuries past when coming up with an agreement to meet or conduct an activity specifically at the site where the dalakit is situated.
             For several generations in pre-Hispanic Dalaguete, the area has always been unofficially called as dalakit. Its accessibility and its reputation as a communal area for community gathering have prompted the Spanish authorities to construct the church and eventually establish the area as part of an encomienda.
              From this common ground, and from this tree, begun the conception of a larger town which later come to be known as Dalaguete.</p>
